##Welcome to climate change chaos 
## your objective plant as many crops as you can before the rising water levels claim the land.

the controls are simple: 
W/A/S/D movement
V plant crop 
C create aquifier rasing the ground water levels on the adjacent tiles
X create a drain that will drain water from the adjacent tiles
Z creates a heater heating the adjacent tiles 

crops can't grow where there is too little water and too much water will destroy crops

Everything has a score :
Crop : - 1 +2 score for crops that suvive an aditional -1 if they die 
aquifier/drain/heater -25
